### Crooklyn's\_Finest\#9525

> HaileyBot is one of my favorite bots! It comes with all the features and diversities from bumping to moderation. I went out of my way to add HaileyBot to my server and watched as it grew and looked more professional. Strongly recommend this bot. Deleted many bots from my server because HaileyBot offers the features of those bots. Quality over quantity, Always.



### DeJzer\#3622

> The bot has a lot of positive functions, the most I like about this bot is communication between other servers, communication is smooth and secure.



### destroyer101AF13\#3379

> Hell yeah, this bot is unique and the creator of it is one to look up too.



### folding.exe\#0001

> The most versatile bot I've seen yet, packed with many features



### Mr. Kristofferson\#9911

> As an Admin for the chat and the main hub of the bot, I do love having the ability to chat with multiple users and servers without the need of randomly reconnecting to a new user/server. I can watch the chat all at once and help out the new users who are intrigued on how the chat, moderation logs and advertisements work. My score: 11/10 IGN. Would recommend to my family.



### Phantom51180\#0206

> I used HaileyBot to replace 4 other bots that all didn't work as well as HaileyBot! I have been looking for a bot to connect multiple servers privately for more than 6 months, HaileyBot does it with ease! The creator is active, and super helpful! Thank you HaileyBot! I look forward to removing future bots from my servers thanks to your future updates. Favorite Discord bot to date!
