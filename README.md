HaileyBot aims to be an incredibly versatile bot; our goal is to have every feature you could ever think of, as well as some you would never even imagine. The overall vision of HaileyBot is to provide the user with a quality product. Unlike many of the "big name" Discord bots, HaileyBot will _never_ integrate any "pay to unlock" commands, or anything else that requires monetary compensation in exchange for basic functionality. HaileyBot was built from the ground up on a foundation based on user satisfaction. The user experience is our top priority, because without the userbase, this bot would not exist.

## Features

### Global Chat

The global chat feature of this bot can link a channel from your server to the bot's global chat simply by typing `$-link`. Any messages sent to a connected channel are forwarded through the bot to all the other connected channels. This has the potential to open up your server to a brand new world of possibilities when it comes to socializing and building an active community. The Global Chat is governed by 7 simple, incredibly reasonable rules, and we have an active staff team to enforce them when needed. This makes Global Chat a fantastic method to meet and converse with new people who you otherwise never would've met.

An expansion to the `$-link` command came in the form of `$-link private`. Similar to the original command, this allows you to connect multiple channels across different servers. The difference is that you aren't stuck using HaileyBot's main Global Chat; you can create your own cross-server communities, and make them the way you want them to be.

### Advertising

HaileyBot's advertising feature allows server admins to create an advertisement for their server using `$-register`, and bump it every 2 hours with `$-bump`. Ad bumps are sent to a designated channel on the bot's support server, where they can be seen by over 650 users. The channel also serves as a way to help out users who are new to Discord, or even older users who want to find a new community to join.

### Moderation

On top of the standard `kick` and `ban` commands that come along with nearly every bot on the platform, HaileyBot also has plenty more less commonly seen moderation commands.

With `$-autorole`, you can make the bot automatically grant roles to new members who join your server. HaileyBot also allows you to set special roles for users based on your server's member count \(for example, a special `@100th` role that gets given to the 100th member\).

The `$-ban` command works how you would expect it to, but on top of the standard functionality of a ban command, HaileyBot can also ban a user by their ID, even if they aren't in your server. Another feature of HaileyBot's ban command is the ability to sync your server's bans with HaileyBot's Global Ban List -- a list of users who have violated HaileyBot's [Global Ban Policy](https://docs.haileybot.com/reference/gbp).

`$-filter` is good for keeping chat clean -- if you don't want people saying certain words, just add those words to the filter. HaileyBot will take care of it from there.

You can use `$-live` to print a message containing your server's statistics. Whenever something changes, the message gets edited to show the change. If a message isn't your style, you can use `$-live channels` to create a category of unjoinable voice channels at the top of your server's channel list. The names of these channels contain your server stats, and, just like the live message, they get updated live as well.

If you want to see what your server members are doing while you're away, you can use `$-modlog` to set a channel to be used as a server log, logging all activities performed in your server.

You can use `$-prune` to bulk delete messages more easily, rather than needing to do it by hand.

With `$-warn`, you can set a warning channel on your server so you can officially warn users for misbehaving. You can also set this channel to notify you if a new member joining your server is known for violating HaileyBot's [Global Ban Policy](https://docs.haileybot.com/reference/gbp).

Using `$-welcome` and `$-goodbye`, you can set personalized messages that appear when members join or leave your server.

### Miscellaneous

This bot also has many commands that don't quite fit any of the categories, such as getting detailed information about a user \(`$-user`\), server \(`$-server`\), or custom emoji \(`$-emote`\), searching google from within Discord \(`$-google`\), recalling an old message from its ID \(`$-quote`\), or creating a poll for server members to vote on with reactions \(`$-poll`\).

## Planned

HaileyBot is under constant development, receiving updates and new features nearly every day. Stay tuned for what'll happen next, and join our community to be a part of this ever growing project.
